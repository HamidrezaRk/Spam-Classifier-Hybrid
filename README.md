# Spam-Classifier-Hybrid

ðŸ“„ Description (Improved)

Dataset:
This project uses the Spambase Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset consists of 4,601 email samples with 57 numerical attributes describing various features such as word frequencies and character patterns.
The target column (is_spam) is binary (0 = not spam, 1 = spam), making it a suitable discrete classification problem.
Source: UCI Spambase Dataset

Algorithms Applied:
To evaluate and improve spam detection accuracy, two supervised machine learning algorithms were applied:
Decision Tree Classifier â€“ A simple and interpretable model based on tree structure.
Random Forest Classifier â€“ An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions for higher accuracy and robustness.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of individual and ensemble tree-based classifiers on a discrete text-based dataset and achieve high accuracy in identifying spam emails.
